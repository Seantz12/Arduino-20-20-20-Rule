# Arduino 20-20-20 Rule

## What is this?

As someone who works in front of a computer all day and lesiures in front of a computer all day, I often
neglet the 20-20-20 rule. The 20-20-20 rule for those who are not aware, is that for every 20 minutes,
you should stare at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

I wanted to create something to help me remember this, and yes there are sites (and probably websites) to
help with this. But I was like hey, I have an arduino kit lying around, I'd figure I'd try to learn some hardware stuff while I was at it.

Thus the creation of this project which takes an arduino device (I used an UNO R3, but a nano should work the same) and hooked it up to a
digital display, a buzzer, and some buttons. The pause button starts the timer, counting down from 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, the buzzer
will activate. Pressing the pause button again turns off the buzzer, and counts down from 20. Once the 20 hits 0, it buzzes again, and hitting the pause
button resets the cycle. You can also pause at any point by hitting the pause button. The reset button unsurprisngly resets the device to 0 essentially.

## How do I use this?

I used PIO to build and flash this onto my arduino. After that, just turn on the arduino with a power source of your choosing, and then hit the pause button.

## Can't I just use a timer?

Yes. There's nothing I like more than hyper specialized devices though so that's why I made this.

## Is there a schematic for this?

Yes, sort of? I've never worked with schematics before so it's probably terrible and awful. I'll... see about fixing it later.

## What about a PCB?

I'm working on it. As part of this project I'm going to trrrry and hook it up to a PCB and make it mini/portable since I think that would be cool.
